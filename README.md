# Sef

I have at least one account on every site on the internet... Seriously. <br>
Remembering all those usernames and passwords is kind of a difficult task... for a human, but not for  **_Sef_**.

**_Sef_** is a simple, console program built with Python that remembers your login information so you don't have to!

******
This was my first _"big"_ Python project. <br> 
It was a good practice for writing conditional logic and getting input from users. <br> 
Also, for this project, I had to learn how to register users, encrypt/decrypt passwords, as well as, basic SQL.
